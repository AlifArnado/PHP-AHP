Analytic Hierarchy Process
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process

Limitations:

The criteria can only have 2 levels but this should be enough for most cases.

How it should work:

1. New class instance / Set the goal
2. Set the criteria
3. Set the alternatives
4. Get the priority matrix
5. Update/set the priorities based on 1-9 values
6. Set the type of values for each criteria (eg. higher is better or lower is better)
7. Set the values for the alternatives (maybe put step 3. just before this one...)
8. Get the results

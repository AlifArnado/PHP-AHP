Analytic Hierarchy Process
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_hierarchy_process

IMPORTANT NOTE: This project is incomplete so the class won't work! I'm not sure if 
and when I will work on it again. If that happens it won't be a simple class anymore 
because I don't see a way it could work like that so it's very likely that I'll 
replace it by a framework or an actual application.

If you want to use the code (it's not much though), feel free to fork it and do 
whatever you want with it.


Limitations:

The criteria can only have 2 levels but this should be enough for most cases.

How it should work:

1. New class instance / Set the goal
2. Set the criteria
3. Set the alternatives
4. Get the priority matrix
5. Update/set the priorities based on 1-9 values
6. Set the type of values for each criteria (eg. higher is better or lower is better)
7. Set the values for the alternatives (maybe put step 3. just before this one...)
8. Get the results
